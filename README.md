# BargainingBot
A Bot that bargains for the price of drinks with customers.

The Bargaining Bot was my final year engineering project. There are various parts to the system.

### The system is made up of :
* #### [The Android App](https://github.com/shounakmulay/BargainingBotAndroidApp) 
* #### Dialogflow as the NLP platform
* #### [Cloud Function as the webhook for Dialogflow](https://github.com/shounakmulay/BargainingBotDialogflowWebhook)
* #### [Tensorflow model](https://github.com/shounakmulay/BargainingBotTensorflowModel)
* #### Another [Cloud Function triggered on a Pub/Sub topic](https://github.com/shounakmulay/BargainingBotDatabasePubSub)
